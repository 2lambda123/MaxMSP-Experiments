# MaxMSP-Experiments
  ## Blue Space
Live granular synthesis (GS) engine based on the Sakonda Granular Synthesis v2.5 patch (http://formantbros.jp/sako/download.html). Features live looping and recording functionality, new sample scrub and random positioning system for evolving textures. 

Definition of GS from Curtis Roads â€“ Granular synthesis deals with sound at a 'quantum' level: the sonic atom being the individual sample (any one of the 44100 taken in a second at the standard sampling rate).

  ## Entropy Cleric
Basic additive synthesizer with wave shape, ADSR, filter, LFO and overdrive controls. Includes a generative MIDI system based on sustained notes (screen input, not MIDI-controller enabled). Twitch Chat Integration (pending full functionality), using 'Chatty' Java app.
